Project Description:
Our project is called "Time Tracker" and is an interactive Time Management 	applicaiton.  Our application aimed to help individuals monitor and predict the amount of time that they were spending on the tasks that they performed throught the day/week.  The home screen of the application introduces you to a timer and task submission section.  
Using Time Tracker:
Once you are at the homepage you can add a new task and input the desired fields in the task submission form.  Once you submit the new task, you can view that task in the "Task List".  On that page it will provide you with all of the details associated with that task, and others that have been previously recorded.  The last page of our web application allows users to dynamically update the graph section.  By updating the graph with the tasks that you wish to compare (up to 5 tasks) the user is able to view how long they were spending on a particular task.  By having this option they are able to better understand how they were allocating their time as well as track how much time they spent on one task in comparison to other tasks that the user has chosen.  Overall our application aims to serve the purpose of a time management applicaiton.
